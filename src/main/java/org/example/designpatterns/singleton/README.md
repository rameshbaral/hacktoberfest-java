<h2>Singleton design pattern</h2>
Singleton design pattern comes under the category of creational design pattern.
This pattern involves a single class which is responsible to create an object while making sure that only single object gets created.
This class provides a way to access its only object which can be accessed directly without need to instantiate the object of the class.
