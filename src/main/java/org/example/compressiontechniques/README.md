## Data Compression

In information theory, data compression, source coding, or bit-rate reduction is the process of encoding information
using fewer bits than the original representation.
Any particular compression is either lossy or lossless.

### Lossless compression

Lossless compression reduces bits by identifying and eliminating statistical redundancy. No information is lost in
lossless compression.
Eg - Run-length encoding , Huffman Coding , Arithmetic Coding.

### Lossy compression

Lossy compression reduces bits by removing unnecessary or less important information.
Eg - JPEG, H.263, DVI (RTV & PLV), MPEG-1, MPEG-2, MPEG-4

Typically, a device that performs data compression is referred to as an encoder, and one that performs the reversal of
the process (decompression) as a decoder.
