Lambda expression provides implementation of functional interface.
An interface which has only one abstract method is called functional interface.
Java provides an annotation `@FunctionalInterface`, which is used to declare an interface as functional interface.<br><br>

**Why use Lambda expressions?**<br>
1. To provide the implementation of Functional interface.
2. Less coding
<br><br>

<h2>Syntax</h3>
`(argument-list) -> {body}`
<br><br>
Java lambda expression is treated as a function, so compiler does not create _**.class**_ file.
